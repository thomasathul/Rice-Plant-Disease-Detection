Detecting diseases in rice plants and classifying them according to it.

Trained Classes:- Bacterial leaf blight, Leaf smut, Brown Spot, Healthy



| Model  | Training Accuracy | Validation Accuracy | 
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------|
| Inception V3 model  |  accuracy: 0.9905  |   accuracy : 0.8198     | 
| MobileNetV2 |   accuracy: 0.9500    | accuracy: 0.8125   |
| SVM Technique |     accuracy : 0.85            |       |
| K Nearest Neighbors |  accuracy: 0.62      |        |
| Decision Tree |     accuracy :  0.54         |          |


Except Inception model, all other models are trained under 4 datasets only



## Observations:
 
Decision  Tree and KNN needs to be improved
